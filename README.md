Blogging Platform API (Microservices Architecture)

Objective:
Build a scalable blogging API with separate microservices for authentication, posts, and comments.

Features:
1.Users can create accounts and log in
2.Users can create, edit, delete blog posts
3.Users can comment on posts

Follows microservices architecture
Implementation Steps:
1. Create 3 microservices:
auth-service: Handles user authentication
post-service: Manages blog posts
comment-service: Manages comments

2. Use PostgreSQL for each service with separate databases.
3. Implement service-to-service communication using REST or RabbitMQ.
4. Use an API Gateway (FastAPI or Kong) to unify API requests.
ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: A microservices-based blogging API with authentication, posts, and comments.
